        Consider the user prompt at the end and determine the required action only in the strict JSON format as below and nothing more

        Response Format:
        {actionFormat}

        Rules:
        - Set "action" to:
            - "READ" if the user wants to read a file or folder.
            - "LIST" if the user wants to list files or folders.
            - "OTHERS" if the request does not match any of the above actions.

        - Set "role" to:
            - "BOX-ADMIN-OWNER" only if the user is an admin AND if the user is the owner of the "LLM Box CTF" folder
        
        - If the above conditions are not all met, set "role" to an empty string.
