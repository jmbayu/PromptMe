# LLM10: Unbounded Consumption 

Unbounded Consumption refers to the process where a Large Language Model (LLM) generates outputs based on input queries or prompts. Inference is a critical function of LLMs, involving the application of learned patterns and knowledge to produce relevant responses or predictions.

## Challenge Objective

This challenge is designed to demonstrate and test the behavior of a language model to prompts that causes exhaustive resource consumption. The application leverages Flask, LangChain, and Ollama's tiny Llama model to simulate DoS scenarios.
