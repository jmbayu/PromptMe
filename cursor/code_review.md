# Comprehensive Code Review: PromptMe

## Overview
PromptMe is a vulnerable application designed to demonstrate the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) Applications. It consists of a main dashboard and 10 challenge sub-components, each illustrating a specific LLM security risk.

## Review Structure
For each aspect, the review includes:
- **Aspect Overview**
- **Expected Goals**
- **Results of Review**
- **Concise Steps to Implement Improvements**

---

## 1. Application Structure & Organization
### Overview
The application is organized into a main Flask app (main.py), a dashboard, and 10 challenge sub-apps under challenges/. Each challenge is self-contained with its own Flask app, templates, and static files.

### Expected Goals
- Clear separation of concerns between main app and challenges
- Consistent structure across challenges
- Easy navigation and maintainability

### Results of Review
- The structure is clear and modular.
- Some inconsistencies in naming and file organization between challenges.
- No central documentation for challenge APIs or endpoints.

### Steps to Improve
- Standardize naming and folder structure across all challenges.
- Add a central documentation file listing all challenge endpoints and their purposes.

---

## 2. Security Practices
### Overview
Each challenge demonstrates a specific LLM security risk. The main app and challenges use Flask, with some using additional libraries (e.g., LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace, Box SDK).

### Expected Goals
- Demonstrate vulnerabilities intentionally, but isolate them from the main app.
- Avoid accidental exposure of secrets or flags outside the intended context.
- Use secure defaults in the main app and non-vulnerable components.

### Results of Review
- Vulnerabilities are intentionally present in challenge code.
- Some hardcoded secrets and flags are present in source files (expected for CTF, but should be isolated).
- Main app uses a static secret key; not suitable for production.
- No environment variable management for secrets in main app.

### Steps to Improve
- Move all secrets/flags to environment variables or config files, loaded only in challenge context.
- Add a warning banner in the main app about intentional vulnerabilities.
- Use a secure secret key for the main app, loaded from environment.

---

## 3. Dependency Management
### Overview
Dependencies are listed in equirements.txt. Some challenges use additional libraries not listed globally.

### Expected Goals
- All required dependencies are listed in equirements.txt.
- No unused or outdated dependencies.

### Results of Review
- Some challenge-specific dependencies may not be in the root equirements.txt.
- No automated dependency update or vulnerability scanning.

### Steps to Improve
- Audit all challenge subfolders for additional dependencies and add them to equirements.txt.
- Use a tool like pip-audit or safety to scan for known vulnerabilities.

---

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance
### Overview
No automated tests or test framework detected.

### Expected Goals
- Basic unit and integration tests for main app and challenges.
- Test coverage for critical paths and challenge logic.

### Results of Review
- No test files or test framework present.
- Manual testing is implied (CTF style), but no automation.

### Steps to Improve
- Add a 	ests/ folder with pytest-based tests for main app and at least one challenge.
- Add CI integration for running tests on PRs.

---

## 5. Documentation
### Overview
Documentation is present in README.md and in some challenge subfolders.

### Expected Goals
- Clear setup, usage, and challenge instructions.
- Documentation for developers and contributors.

### Results of Review
- Main README.md is comprehensive.
- Some challenge-specific docs are missing or inconsistent.

### Steps to Improve
- Add or update README.md in each challenge folder.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md for developer guidelines.

---

## 6. Code Quality & Maintainability
### Overview
Code is functional and focused on demonstrating vulnerabilities.

### Expected Goals
- Readable, modular code with comments where needed.
- Avoidance of code duplication.

### Results of Review
- Code is generally readable, but some duplication across challenges.
- Some functions lack docstrings or comments.

### Steps to Improve
- Refactor common logic into shared utilities where possible.
- Add docstrings and comments to key functions.

---

## 7. Windows Compatibility
### Overview
The main app notes that Windows compatibility is in progress.

### Expected Goals
- All scripts and commands should work on Windows (no && chaining, use PowerShell syntax).

### Results of Review
- Some setup instructions use Unix-style commands.
- No PowerShell equivalents provided.

### Steps to Improve
- Add Windows-specific setup instructions in the README.md.
- Use cross-platform compatible scripts where possible.

---

## 8. Challenge-Specific Issues
### Overview
Each challenge demonstrates a unique LLM security risk. Some have additional issues (e.g., hardcoded secrets, lack of input validation, etc.).

### Expected Goals
- Each challenge should clearly demonstrate its intended vulnerability.
- No accidental vulnerabilities outside the challenge scope.

### Results of Review
- Challenges are effective for educational purposes.
- Some could benefit from clearer separation of vulnerable and non-vulnerable code.

### Steps to Improve
- Add comments in code to clearly mark intentionally vulnerable sections.
- Isolate vulnerable logic from general app logic.

# Summary
PromptMe is a well-structured educational project for LLM security, but would benefit from improved documentation, dependency management, code quality, and Windows compatibility. The above steps will improve maintainability and developer experience while preserving the CTF/educational intent.
