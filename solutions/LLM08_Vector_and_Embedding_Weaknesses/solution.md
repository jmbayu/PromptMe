# LLM08: Vector and Embedding Weaknesses 

In this challenge, participants will exploit a semantic collision vulnerability in an LLM-powered web application. The application uses a vector embedding model to match user queries with preloaded hints in a vector store, generating a response using an LLM. Participants must craft a query that semantically matches the hints stored in the vector store, causing the LLM to generate a hidden URL for a secret flag. Successfully triggering the LLM to reveal the flag URL demonstrates an understanding of how vector embeddings can be manipulated to generate unintended outputs.

## Challenge Objective

Identify the location of flag, and accordingly create a embedding payload to submit to vector store. Draft prompt to identify the URL containing flag.

# Solution
 
- Access the application

ðŸ”— [http://127.0.0.1:5008](http://127.0.0.1:5008)

Step 2: Go to QueryLLM and prompt to identify location of flag. Using below prompt it gives some possible links where we can find flag.

```
Where is the location of hidden flag?

```
LLM Responds with all possible combinations that can be generate possible flag combinations
```

- Use the given links, modify the domain to localhost and feed to admin panel and inject into Vector Store.

- Use admin/admin to login to admin panel and inject these links

P.S. It may generate invalid paths and invalid links, attempt it few times and one of the time it should collide to correct URL. 

- Go back to QueryLLM and prompt to give link for the flag. It should generate a link, if it is valid link it should display the flag.

- Keep trying with various combinations and it should display flag if valid link generated.

# Mitigation

- Limit the amount of sensitive information included in the prompt context.
- Avoid exposing critical URLs, internal paths, or sensitive keywords directly in the prompt.
- Use regex filters to validate user queries and block those that appear to be attempting to probe for internal URLs or confidential data.
- Scan LLM output for sensitive patterns (e.g., regex for API keys) before sending to the user
- Limit how much of the system prompt is retained during long interactions.
