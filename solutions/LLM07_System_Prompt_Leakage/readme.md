# Mitigation

- Never Embed Secrets/Sensitive information in Prompts
- Create distinct chat flows for trusted/internal users vs. public-facing ones.
- Scan LLM output for sensitive patterns (e.g., regex for API keys) before sending to the user
- Limit how much of the system prompt is retained during long interactions.
